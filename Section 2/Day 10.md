- Click on `Add a user`
- Follow the steps to, fill in fake information to create a user and assign them `Microsoft 365 E5 license (no Teams)` 

If you have multiple Microsoft 365 E5 licenses then you can create multiple users but in my case I only had one `Microsoft 365 E5 license` which was already assigned to to my existing test user (cyberlearner@cyberlearner.onmicrosoft.com). Therefore, I did not create any more users.

## Activate user's outlook mailbox

- Navigate to [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/)
- Login with your test user's credentials 
- This will activate the user's mailbox
